3 LED Blink Project

This project uses an Arduino to blink 3 LEDs at different speeds and different numbers of blinks:

- The blue LED blinks 5 times
- The red LED blinks 10 times
- The white LED blinks 15 times

Each LED has a resistor connected in series to protect it from too much current.


The LEDs are connected to digital pins 13, 8, and 3 on the Arduino, with the longer leg (anode) connected through a resistor to the pin, and the shorter leg (cathode) connected to GND.

What I Learned:

- How to control multiple LEDs independently
- Using for loops in Arduino code
- Basic breadboard and circuit wiring
